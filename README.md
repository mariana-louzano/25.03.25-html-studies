# 25.03.25-html-studies / HTML Practice – Getting Started
<h5><i>late night studying html</i></h5>

This repository contains my first practical exercises (VSCode) using pure HTML, as part of my initial journey into web development.
I've been using Codédex and Mimo app to learn as well.

## What I Practiced

During this stage, I worked with the following foundational HTML concepts:

- Basic structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h4>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists
- List items (`<li>`)
- Adding images with `<img>`, including the `alt` attribute
- Creating links using `<a>` and the `target="_blank"` attribute
- Basic form inputs:
  - `<input type="text">`, `<input type="number">`
  - `<button>`
  - `placeholder` attribute

## Purpose

The goal was to build a simple, functional page using only HTML. The focus was on understanding structure and semantics, without CSS or JavaScript at this stage.

## Next Steps

- Keep practicing input fields and complete forms
- Learn how to create tables in HTML
- Study basic site navigation (internal and external anchors)
- Gradually start working with CSS for styling
